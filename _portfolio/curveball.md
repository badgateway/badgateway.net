Curveball is a micro-framework for building APIs with Typescript in Node.js. Fast, lightweight and fully open source, Curveball provides substantial improvements over legacy frameworks like Express. Curveball is heavily inspired by [Koa](https://koajs.com/). If you used Koa in the past, this is going to look pretty familiar.

 
- A small core. Curveball is a _micro_-framework (~500k unzipped)
- Batteries included: Optional plugins for lots of common tasks.
- Gets HTTP. Use modern features such as **HTTP/2 Push**, **Content-Negotation**, **1xx responses**, the **Prefer header** and **Links** headers.
- Serverless friendly. Built-in AWS Lambda support.
- Completely written in and for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).
- Modern ECMAScript features including support for x, y and z
- Async/await-based middleware
- Native support for HTTP/2, including easy access to HTTP/2 Push
- All the latest HTTP features, such as [103 Early Hints](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8297)
- Easily do internal sub-requests without having to do a real HTTP request.
