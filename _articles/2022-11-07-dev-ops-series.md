title: Accelerating Your Release Cycles
author: Michael
---

As a web application moves from the MVP phase to the finding product-market fit phase, the deployment and management requirements of the application change. You are no longer solely concerned with churning out features as fast as possible to launch your MVP. When you’re finding product-market fit, your main focus shifts to making iterative changes and learning from how your customers are using the product. Making the iteration and learning cycles faster means you’ll find product-market fit sooner (or realize you need to pivot before running out of runway).

#### Series Overview

This is a series of four topics around aspects of continuous delivery specifically targeted at teams that are building applications in the post-MVP phase while trying to find product-market fit. These topics are specifically focused on helping speed up the iteration and learning cycle.
- [Monitoring and Observability](/articles/monitoring-observability-feature-flags#monitoring-and-observability)
- [Feature Flags](/articles/monitoring-observability-feature-flags#feature-flags)
- Small Releases & Quick Rollbacks
- Automated Testing

From a more technical perspective, [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net) is a great resource for architecting your web application and release process for scalability. Many of the topics discussed in this series of posts will assume or rely on these factors existing in your web application already. If your application doesn't adhere to The Twelve-Factor App but your application and processes would benefit from the topics discussed in these posts, then it's time to think about improving the architecture of your apps.
