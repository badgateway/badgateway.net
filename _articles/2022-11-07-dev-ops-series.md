As a web application moves from the MVP phase to the finding product-market fit phase, the deployment and management requirements of the application change. You are no longer solely concerned with churning out features as fast as possible to launch your MVP.

This is a series of four articles around aspects of continuous delivery specifically targeted at teams that are building applications in the post-MVP phase while trying to find product-market fit. These topics are specifically focused on helping speed up the iteration and learning cycle.
- Monitoring and Observability
- Feature Flags
- Small Releases & Quick Rollbacks
- Automated Testing

From a more technical perspective, [The Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net) is a great resource for architecting your web application for scalability. Many of the topics discussed in this series of posts will assume or rely on these factors existing in your web application already.
