## Developing

This is a [Jekyll site](https://jekyllrb.com/) - getting up and running with this is pretty easy!

1. Ensure you have ruby >= 2.5.0 (if you're on a mac you're probably good)
2. Install `jekyll` and `bundler`: `gem install jekyll bundler`
3. Compile, serve the site with: `bundle exec jekyll serve --livereload`
